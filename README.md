## Project Description for My Reads App

This is a practice exercise for the 'React.js Fundamentals' section of Udacity's React Nanodegree. This React App has two pages: the main (HomePage) page and a search page (SearchPage). Also, I divided this project into 3 components: Shelf, Book, and Options-Dropdown.

On the Home Page, we can go through three book lists:
- books currently being read
- books that you wish to read
- books that you have already read
 
On the Search Page, you can enter a search query to find other books to add to your lists.
The "react-router-dom" has been used to implement routing. As a result, the back button and the add new-book button functionality are completely operational. 



The application was created with 
## create-react-app
and requires only 
## npm install   &&    npm start 
to get it installed and launched.




# Getting Started with Create React App

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
